I am an atmospheric scientist based in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. My academic background is in meteorology (BS from Plymouth State, MS from San Francisco State) and my PhD is in atmospheric sciences with a focus in atmospheric chemistry from Texas A&M University. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Kevin Gurney's group](https://gurneylab.nau.edu/) at Northern Arizona University. When I am not working, I am an avid long distance runner and snowboarder, and I enjoy lots of other outdoor activities.

**Research interets:**
* Gas phase atmospheric emissions
* Air quality
* Greenhouse gases
* Oil and gas/energy systems
* Urban atmospheres
* Climate/environmental policy
* General meteorology and climate science
