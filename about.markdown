I am an atmospheric scientist based in Flagstaff, Arizona, USA. My academic background is in meteorology (BS from Plymouth State, MS from San Francisco State) and I have a PhD in Atmospheric Aciences with a focus in atmospheric chemistry from Texas A&M University. I am formerly a postdoctoral researcher in [Kevin Gurney's group](https://gurneylab.nau.edu/) at Northern Arizona University, where I worked on the Vulcan and Hestia CO2 emissions data products. I was most recently a technical lead with [Crosswalk Labs](https://www.crosswalk.io/), where I developed new CO2 emissions data products, including GPS-based onroad CO2 emissions and a building-level energy model based on more than 70,000 building energy benchmarking records. When I am not working, I am an avid long distance runner and snowboarder, and I enjoy lots of other outdoor activities.

**Research interests:**
* Gas phase atmospheric emissions
* Greenhouse gases
* Carbon accounting and verification
* Air quality
* Oil and gas/energy systems
* Urban atmospheres
* Climate/environmental policy
* General meteorology and climate science
