# Vulcan

![image](/assets/images/map.png)

Vulcan is a data-driven fossil fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO2) emissions product for the entire United States. My involvement in Vulcan includes transfering Vulcan v3.0 code onto NAU's Monsoon supercomputing cluster, updating the code for Monsoon's architecture, running the code to produce output, and gridding the output. Documentation for Vulcan v3.0 is available [here](http://vulcan.rc.nau.edu/assets/files/Vulcan.v3.core.manuscript.5.11.2020.JGR.submit.pdf) and the [hourly](https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1810) and [annual](https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1741) datasets are available through the Oak Ridge DAAC. For specific regridding needs, please contact myself of Kevin Gurney.
